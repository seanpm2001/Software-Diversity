# Software Diversity

## What is software diversity?

Software Diversity is the method of using multiple languages for a single project, instead of writing everything in a small subset of languages (EG: C, Python, C++, Makefile, and Google Go) software diversity aims for using even more languages per project, so that other languages get a better representation. For example, you may want to try using a more obscure language every once in a while (such as Red, Elm & or E) instead of writing it in a different language.

There are thousands of programming languages. Software Diversity hopes to make all of them common.
